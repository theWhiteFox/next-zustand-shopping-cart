This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Web Front-End Developer Test

Objective: Build a basic “Item List and Cart” application using a React framework of your choice (Next.js preferred not mandated) to demonstrate skills in component structure, state management, and responsive design.

Task: Create a simple e-commerce-style app with a list of items and a cart page.

Requirements (Approximately 2 Hours):

•             Item List Page (/items):

o             Display a list of items (with name, price, and an “Add to Cart” button).

o             If using Next.js or a similar framework, demonstrate server-side rendering or static data fetching for item data.

o             Show a minimum of 5 items.

•             Cart Page (/cart):

o             Manage cart operations using a state management approach that aligns with the chosen framework.

o             Display a summary of items added to the cart, including the total price.

o             Allow users to remove items from the cart.

•             Responsive Design: Ensure the layout is responsive and looks good on both desktop and mobile screens.

Bonus (Optional):

•             Implement local storage or a similar method to persist cart data on page reloads.

•             Add quantity adjustments for items in the cart.

Notes: This task is designed to be completed in about 2 hours. If time is limited, focus on core functionality, and include a short note in the README describing any additional features or design decisions.
